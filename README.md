# Discord4J Documentation

Source for the documentation informing developers 
on the use of Discord4J (A Discord API wrapper written for Java).
If the docs are just a bit too overwhelming, or not covering
what you need chances are someone is available to
help you on the Discord API semi-official [server](https://discord.gg/0SBTUU1wZTYLhAAW).
If you do choose to do this (we won't bite you!) please keep in mind you should
be seeking help within the channel titled 'java_discord4j'
